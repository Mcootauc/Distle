Distle is a java program where you play Wordle, but the length of the word you're trying to guess is random. After each guess, the program tells you the edit distance between the random word and the guess word and the transformations needed to guess the random word. The transformations include, Insertion, Deletion, Replacement, and Transposition. This program takes the random word from a dictionary text and has the option to let an AI guess the word instead of the user. 

The goal is to guess the random word with the least amount of guesses. 

The user or AI uses the edit distance and transforms given to guess the random word.  

The purpose of this program is to practice using the memoization structure, edit distance between two strings, and transformations.

To play this game, run the file, "DistleGame", in an IDE.
